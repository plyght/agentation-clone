**Full Title:** Agent Integrator | Stop Leaving Money on the Table

---

## Executive Summary

Agent Integrator is an **AI Venture Studio** that operates through two distinct business models: Development Services (building custom AI systems for existing businesses) and Platform Partnerships (co-founding AI companies with domain experts). The company positions itself as an alternative to traditional dev shops and agencies by offering outcome-based work with deeper technical and business alignment.

---

## 1. What Agent Integrator Does

### Core Identity
**"AI Venture Studio"** — not a dev shop, not an agency, but a hybrid technical partner that either:
1. Builds custom AI systems for existing businesses (services model)
2. Co-founds AI companies with non-technical founders (equity partnership model)

### Value Proposition
> "Don't get left behind."

- Builds AI systems that **replace manual work**
- Co-builds AI companies with **founders who bring the vision**
- Focuses on **working systems**, not consulting deliverables
- Sells **outcomes**, not hours

### Key Differentiators
| Traditional Option | Their Approach | Agent Integrator |
|-------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Contractors** | Build to spec | Build what actually works |
| **Agencies** | Deliver and move on | Stick around, iterate |
| **Cofounders** | N/A | "Skin in the game" |
